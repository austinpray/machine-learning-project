## UT Dallas Coursebook

This was obtained from the https://coursebook.utdallas.edu/ 

We hope to classify professors by the prefixes of the courses they teach. We want to see if a professor that teaches in CS often cross-teaches in the Math department.

```{r}
library(readr)

coursebook = read.csv("data/utd-coursebook.csv")

summary(coursebook)
```

## Peek at the data

```{r}
head(coursebook)
tail(coursebook)
```

## Let's see the professors with highest number of classes

```{r}
topProfs = sort(table(coursebook$instructors), decreasing = T)
dotchart(head(topProfs, 20))
```

## Let's see the enrollment for departments

```{r}
aggregate(coursebook$enrollment, by=list(coursebook$dept), FUN=sum)
```

## Chord

```{r}
plot(coursebook$class.title, coursebook$enrollment)
```
